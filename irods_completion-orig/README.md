# iCommand Completions Ported from bash

These iCommands tab completions are ported from the bash script
[i-commands-auto.bash](https://github.com/irods/irods-legacy/blob/master/iRODS/irods_completion.bash)
by Bruno Bzeznik.


## [Installation](#installation)

To install the ported completions, copy the contents of the directory `functions/` into
`<base>/functions/` and the contents `completions/` into `<base>/completions/`. If installing for
yourself, `<base>` is `$HOME/.config/fish`, otherwise `/etc/fish`.
