# iCommand Completions Ported from bash

These iCommands tab completions are ported from the bash script
[`irods_completion.bash`](https://github.com/irods/irods-legacy/blob/master/iRODS/irods_completion.bash)
by Bruno Bzeznik.


## Installation

To install the functions and tab completions locally, they need to be copied into the
 `.config/fish/functions/` and `.config/fish/completions/` directories under the user's home
 directory, respectively. To install them system wide, they need to be copied into
`/etc/fish/functions/` and `/etc/fish/completions/`, respectively.
