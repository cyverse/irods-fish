# iCommmands Tab Completions

This folder contains support for robust, fish-style tab completions for iRODS iCommands.

__TODO Implement tab completions for the remaining iCommands.__

Here are the iCommands that whose completion implementations don't exist or are incomplete. If the first character is a `-`, it is an admin command requiring the user to be a `rodsadmin`. The number after the first character is how many times the iCommand shows up in my history. The are list in order of popularity. I plan to implement or complete the implementations of the tab completions for the iCommands in this order, deferring those marked with `-` to the end. After even the admin commands are implemented, implement completion for `iquest` general queries.

## [Installation](#installation)

To install the functions and tab completions, copy the contents of the directories `../functions/` and `functions/` into `<base>/functions/`, and copy the contents of `completions/` into `<base>/completions/`.  If installing for yourself, `<base>` is `$HOME/.config/fish`, otherwise `/etc/fish`.

## Acknowledgment

The iCommands tab completions are derived from i-commands-auto.bash, https://github.com/irods/irods-legacy/blob/master/iRODS/irods_completion.bash, by Bruno Bzeznik.
