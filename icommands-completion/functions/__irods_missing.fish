# This function accepts a list of input parameters. It determines if all of
# those parameters are missing from its input. This is typically used to test if
# the current commandline of a command being tab completed contains any of a set
# of arguments. A completion test function would pipe the output of an
# __irods_tokenize_cmdline call into this function.
