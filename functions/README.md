# Shared Functions

This folder contains internal functions shared by the environment support and iCommands completions.

__TODO__ _Once all of the `irods_completion-orig` completions have been implemented in `icommands-completion`, the functions shared between the two, i.e., `__irods_join_path`, `__irods_path_suggestions`, and `__irods_split_path` should be moved back to `icommands-completion`._
