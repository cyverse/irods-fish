fish Completions

Here are some fish tab completions to go along with the irods-fish functions and iCommands.

__TODO Implement tab completions for the remaining iCommands.__
Here are the iCommands that whose completion implementations don't exist or are incomplete. If the
first character is a `-`, it is an admin command requiring the user to be a `rodsadmin`. The number
after the first character is how many times the iCommand shows up in my history. The are list in
order of popularity. I plan to implement or complete the implementations of the tab completions for
the iCommands in this order, deferring those marked with `-` to the end. After even the admin
commands are implemented, implement completion for `iquest` general queries.
