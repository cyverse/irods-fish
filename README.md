# fish Shell Support for iRODS

This project provides support for working with iRODS command line tools within the
[fish shell](https://fishshell.com/).

The [`environment`](environment/README.md) folder contains functions that assist with working in
multiple iRODS environments.

The [`irods_completion-orig`](irods_completion-org/README.md) folder contains a port of Bruno
Bzeznik's bash script
[i-commands-auto.bash](https://github.com/irods/irods-legacy/blob/master/iRODS/irods_completion.bash)
to fish.

The [`icommands-completion`](icommands-completion/README.md) folder contains an incomplete set of
tab completions for iCommands.
